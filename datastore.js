    "description": "<p>We have a fairly steady group of 5-8 that already meets here. Some are not on Meetup, so you're unlikely to see them online.</p> <p>Preference tends to ebb and flow somewhere inbetween competitive, \"thinky,\" sometimes heavier, \"blocky\" Euros and occasional high-conflict area control games. Still, there are lighter, but mentally engaging games played - usually inbetween.</p> <p>There hasn't been much interest in 18xx, TI, hex-and-counter, chit-pull, or COIN games, although you might find someone to play with. There's little interest in fantasy themes in general, dungeon crawlers, or most co-ops, as well as generally no interest in RPGs or miniature gaming, except a couple of people have been dabbling into Shadespire lately. There's usually some x-wing happening in the game store, but that's not part of our group. There is some interest in playing abstracts, but somewhat limited on Saturdays.</p> <p>Perhaps unlike some other meet-ups posted, there's not much \"assistance\" in this group in particular - if you're coming, usually it's easier if you've been exposed to designer games before and somewhat familiar with the games being mentioned, or contemporary game mechanics in general (drafting, worker placement, resource conversion, tableau building, etc.).</p> <p>We are friendly and happy to explain the games thoroughly, but this group in particular probably isn't the best for \"just getting into board games.\"</p> <p>I'll try to post what people are proposing or interested in playing on the Friday before. Feel free to ask questions, request, or post preferences of games if you'd like to join us.</p> <p>Spots are capped only by the capacity of the shop, so feel free to always come.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We have a fairly steady group of 5-8 that already meets here. Some are not on Meetup, so you're unlikely to see them online.</p> <p>Preference tends to ebb and flow somewhere inbetween competitive, \"thinky,\" sometimes heavier, \"blocky\" Euros and occasional high-conflict area control games. Still, there are lighter, but mentally engaging games played - usually inbetween.</p> <p>There hasn't been much interest in 18xx, TI, hex-and-counter, chit-pull, or COIN games, although you might find someone to play with. There's little interest in fantasy themes in general, dungeon crawlers, or most co-ops, as well as generally no interest in RPGs or miniature gaming, except a couple of people have been dabbling into Shadespire lately. There's usually some x-wing happening in the game store, but that's not part of our group. There is some interest in playing abstracts, but somewhat limited on Saturdays.</p> <p>Perhaps unlike some other meet-ups posted, there's not much \"assistance\" in this group in particular - if you're coming, usually it's easier if you've been exposed to designer games before and somewhat familiar with the games being mentioned, or contemporary game mechanics in general (drafting, worker placement, resource conversion, tableau building, etc.).</p> <p>We are friendly and happy to explain the games thoroughly, but this group in particular probably isn't the best for \"just getting into board games.\"</p> <p>I'll try to post what people are proposing or interested in playing on the Friday before. Feel free to ask questions, request, or post preferences of games if you'd like to join us.</p> <p>Spots are capped only by the capacity of the shop, so feel free to always come.</p>",
